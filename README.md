# Asynchronous_V-S_Synchronous_FileSystemInNodeJS
Let us take example of restaurant to understand the difference between Asynchronous and Synchronous Files.

Suppose, there are two customer namely, Alexa and Siri comes to restaurant to oder some food.
Here Alexa comes first and then Siri.
So, the waiter will take the oder of Alexa first and then Siri.
Chefs will prepare food of Alexa first and then that of Siri.
Thus, food will be delivered to Alexa first and then Siri.
This is Synchronous way of delivering the food.

Now, in the same situation consider the food preparation time of 20 mintues and 10 minutes of Alexa and Siri respectively.
In this position, food will be deliver to Siri first as it take less time to prepare.
This is Asynchronous way of delivering the food.


I hope you understood the basic difference.
You will see in the repository, there are two js files.
Kindly go through it to see the practical implementation in Node.js
